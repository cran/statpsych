\description{
Computes the sample size required to estimate a Pearson correlation with
desired confidence interval precision in applications where an estimated
Pearson correlation from a prior study is available. The actual confidence
interval width in the planned study will depend on the value of the
estimated correlation in the planned study. An estimated correlation from
a prior study can be used to compute a prediction interval for the value of
the estimated correlation in the planned study, which is then used as a
planning value in the sample size analysis. If the prediction interval
includes 0, then the correlation planning value is set to 0; otherwise, the
correlation planning value is set to the lower prediction limit (if the prior
correlation is positive) or the upper prediction limit (if the prior correlation
is negative). The probability that the prediction interval will have a width that
is less than the desired width in the planned study is approximately 1 - alpha2.

This sample size approach assumes that the population Pearson correlation
that was estimated in the prior study is very similar to the population Pearson
correlation that will be estimated in the planned study. If an estimated
Pearson correlation from a prior study is not available the researcher must use
expert opinion to guess the value of the Pearson correlation that will be
observed in the planned study. The \link[statpsych]{size.ci.cor} function uses
a correlation planning value that is based on expert opinion regarding the
likely value of the correlation estimate that will be observed in the planned
study.
