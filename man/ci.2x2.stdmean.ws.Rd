\title{Computes confidence intervals of standardized effects in a 2x2
within-subjects design}
\usage{
ci.2x2.stdmean.ws(alpha, y11, y12, y21, y22)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alpha level for 1-alpha confidence}

\item{y11}{vector of scores at level 1 of A and level 1 of B}

\item{y12}{vector of scores at level 1 of A and level 2 of B}

\item{y21}{vector of scores at level 2 of A and level 1 of B}

\item{y22}{vector of scores at level 2 of A and level 2 of B}
}
\value{
Returns a 7-row matrix (one row per effect). The columns are:
\itemize{
\item Estimate - estimated standardized effect
\item adj Estimate - bias adjusted standardized effect estimate
\item SE - standard error
\item LL - lower limit of the confidence interval
\item UL - upper limit of the confidence interval
}
}
\description{
Computes confidence intervals for standardized AB interaction effect, main
effect of A, main effect of B, simple main effects of A, and simple main
effects of B in a 2x2 within-subjects factorial design. Equality of
population variances is not assumed. A square root unweighted average
variance standardizer is used.
