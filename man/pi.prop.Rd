\description{
Computes an approximate one-sided or two-sided prediction interval for the
estimated proportion in a future study with a planned sample size of n.
The prediction interval uses a proportion estimate from a prior study that
had a sample size of n0.

Several confidence interval sample size functions in this package require
a planning value of the expected sample value of a proportion in the
planned study. A one-sided proportion prediction limit is useful as a
proportion planning value for a conservatively large sample size required
to obtain a confidence interval with desired width. This strategy for
specifying a proportion planning value is useful in applications where the
population proportion in the prior study is assumed to be very similar to
the population proportion in the planned study.

For sample size planning, use an upper prediction limit if the population
proportion is assumed to be less than .5; and if the upper prediction limit
is greater than .5, set the proportion planning value to .5. Use a lower
prediction limit if the population proportion is asumed to be greater than
.5; and if the lower prediction limit is less than .5, set the proportion
planning value to .5.
