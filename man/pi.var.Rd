\item{type}{\itemize{
\item set to 1 for two-sided prediction interval

}}
}
\value{
Returns two-sided or one-sided prediction limit(s) of an estimate variance
in a future study
}
\description{
Computes a two-sided or one-sided prediction limit for the estimated
variance in a future study for a planned sample size of n. The prediction
limit uses a variance estimate from a prior study of size n0.

Several confidence interval sample size functions in this package require
a planning value of the expected sample variance in the planned study.
A one-sided upper variance prediction limit is useful as a variance
planning value for a conservatively large sample size required to obtain
a confidence interval with desired width. This strategy for specifying a
variance planning value is useful in applications where the population
variance in the prior study is assumed to be very similar to the population
variance in the planned study.
