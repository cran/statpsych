\title{Sample size for a test of a within-subjects mean linear contrast}
\usage{
size.test.lc.mean.ws(alpha, pow, var, es, cor, q)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alpha level for hypothesis test}

\item{pow}{desired power}

\item{var}{planning value of average variance of measurements}

\item{es}{planning value of linear contrast of means}

\item{cor}{planning value of average correlation between measurements}

\item{q}{vector of with-subjects contrast coefficients}
}
\value{
Returns the required sample size
}
\description{
Computes the sample size required to test a linear contrast of population
means with desired power in a within-subjects design. Set the average variance
planning value to the largest value within a plausible range for a
conservatively large sample size. Set the average correlation planning value to
the smallest value within a plausible range for a conservatively large sample
size.
