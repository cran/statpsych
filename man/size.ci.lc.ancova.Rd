\title{Sample size for a linear contrast confidence interval in an ANCOVA}
\usage{
size.ci.lc.ancova(alpha, evar, s, d, w, v)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alpha level for 1-alpha confidence}

\item{evar}{planning value of within group (error) variance}

\item{s}{number of covariates}

\item{d}{largest standardized mean difference for all covariates}

\item{w}{desired confidence interval width}

\item{v}{vector of between-subjects contrast coefficients}
}
\value{
Returns the required sample size for each group
}
\description{
Computes the sample size for each group (assuming equal sample sizes)
required to estimate a population linear contrast of means in an ANCOVA model
with desired confidence interval precision. In a nonexperimental design,
the sample size is affected by the magnitude of covariate mean differences
across groups. The covariate mean differences can be approximated by
specifying the largest standardized covariate mean difference across all
pairwise group differences and for all covariates. In an experiment, this
standardized mean difference should be set to 0. Set the error variance
planning value to the largest value within a plausible range for a
conservatively large sample size.
