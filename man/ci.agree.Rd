\title{Confidence interval for a G-index of agreement}
\usage{
ci.agree(alpha, n, f, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alpha level for 1-alpha confidence}

\item{n}{sample size}

\item{f}{number of objects rated in agreement}

\item{k}{number of rating categories}
}
\value{
Returns a 1-row matrix. The columns are:
\itemize{
\item Estimate - maximum likelihood estimate of G-index
\item SE - standard error
\item LL - lower limit of the adjusted Wald confidence interval
\item UL - upper limit of the adjusted Wald confidence interval
}
}
\description{
Computes an adjusted Wald confidence interval for a G-index of agreement
between two polychotomous ratings. This function requires the number of
objects that were given the same rating by both raters. The G-index
corrects for chance agreement. The G-index is a better measure of
agreement than Cohen's kappa, and the confidence interval for the G-index
used here has better small-sample properties than the confidence interval
for Cohen's kappa.
