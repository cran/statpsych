\title{Sample size for a proportion confidence interval using an estimated
proportion from a prior study}
\usage{
size.ci.prop.prior(alpha1, alpha2, p0, n0, w)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha1}{alpha level for 1-alpha1 confidence in the planned study}

\item{alpha2}{alpha level for the 1-alpha2 prediction interval}

\item{p0}{estimated proportion in prior study}

\item{n0}{sample size in prior study}

\item{w}{desired confidence interval width}
}
\value{
Returns the required sample size
}
\description{
Computes the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with
desired confidence interval precision in applications where an estimated
proportion from a prior study is available. The actual confidence interval
width in the planned study will depend on the value of the estimated
proportion in the planned study. An estimated proportion from a prior study
is used to predict the value of the estimated proportion in the planned
study, and the predicted proportion estimate is then used as a planning
value in the sample size computation. The probability that the prediction
interval in the planned study will have a width that is less than the desired
width is approximately 1 - alpha2.

This sample size approach assumes that the population proportion in the
prior study is very similar to the population proportion in the planned
study. If an estimated proportion from a prior study is not available the
researcher must use expert opinion to guess the value of the proportion
that will be observed in the planned study. The \link[statpsych]{size.ci.prop}
function uses a proportion planning value that is based on expert opinion
regarding the likely value of the proportion estimate that will be observed
in the planned study.
