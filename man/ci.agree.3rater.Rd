\title{Computes confidence intervals for a 3-rater design with dichotomous ratings}
\usage{
ci.agree.3rater(alpha, f)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alpha level for 1-alpha confidence}

\item{f}{vector of frequency counts from 2x2x2 table where
f = [ f111, f112, f121, f122, f211, f212, f221, f222 ],
first subscript represents the rating of rater 1,
second subscript represents the rating of rater 2, and
third subscript represents the rating of rater 3}
}
\value{
Returns a 7-row matrix. The rows are:
\itemize{
\item G(1,2): G-index for raters 1 and 2
\item G(1,3): G-index for raters 1 and 3
\item G(2,3): G-index for raters 2 and 3
\item G(1,2)-G(1,3): difference in G(1,2) and G(1,3)
\item G(1,2)-G(2,3): difference in G(1,2) and G(2,3)
\item G(2,3)-G(1,3): difference in G(2,3) and G(1,3)
\item G(3): G-index of unanimous agreement for all three raters
}

The columns are:
\itemize{
\item Estimate - estimate of G-index (two-rater, difference, or unanimous)
\item LL - lower limit of adjusted Wald confidence interval
\item UL - upper limit of adjusted Wald confidence interval
}
}
\description{
Computes adjusted Wald confidence intervals for a G-index of agreement for
all pairs of raters in a 3-rater design with a dichotomous rating, and
computes adjusted Wald confidence intervals for differences of all pairs of
G agreement. An adjusted Wald confidence interval for unanimous G agreement
among the three raters is also computed. In the three-rater design,
unanimous G agreement is equal to the average of all pairs of G agreement.
The G-index corrects for chance agreement.
