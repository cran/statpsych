\usage{
pi.cor(alpha, cor, n0, n, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alpha value for 1-alpha confidence}

\item{cor}{estimated Pearson correlation from prior study}

\item{n0}{sample size used to estimate the correlation in prior study}

\item{n}{planned sample size of future study}

\item{type}{\itemize{
\item set to 1 for two-sided prediction interval
\item set to 2 for one-sided upper prediction limit
\item set to 3 for one-sided lower prediction limit
}}
}
\value{
Returns one-sided or two-sided prediction limit(s) of an estimated
Pearson correlation in a future study
}
\description{
Computes approximate one-sided or two-sided prediction limits for the
estimated Pearson correlation in a future study with a planned sample
size of n. The prediction interval uses a correlation estimate from a
prior study that had a sample size of n0.

Several confidence interval sample size functions in this package require
a planning value of the expected sample value of a Pearson correlation
in the planned study. A one-sided lower correlation prediction limit is
useful as a correlation planning value for a conservatively large sample
size required to obtain a confidence interval with desired width. This
strategy for specifying a correlation planning value is useful in
applications where the population correlation in the prior study is
assumed to be very similar to the population correlation in the planned
study.
